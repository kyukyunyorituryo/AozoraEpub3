Modified AozoraEpub3
============
description of the modified version
------------
This is a fork version that aims to be close to the "[DPFJ EPUB 3 File Creation Guide](https://dpfj.or.jp/counsel/guide)". When using Aozora Epub 3 for electronic publishing purposes, the original version may not pass the review. Through EPUB validation, we ensure that many EPUB viewers have no display problems.

Due to a Java licensing issue, we decided to build with the AdoptOpenJDK. https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html OpenJDK 21 (LTS), HotSpot, OS, and Install JRE.
